# GitOps DevOps Lab Series – FameTech NYC

## Project Overview

This repository documents my hands-on Git and GitHub learning experience as a Junior DevOps Engineer at FameTech NYC. Each lab simulates real-world GitOps workflows for source control, collaboration, branching strategies, and open-source contribution — all aligned with DevOps team workflows used in CI/CD environments.

The labs are structured as sprint-based tickets and designed to reflect version control scenarios that DevOps engineers face in infrastructure automation, tooling pipelines, and collaborative engineering environments.

> This project experience is verifiable via FameTech NYC upon request.

## Real-World Simulation

These labs simulate workflows that would be expected of a DevOps engineer working on:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) projects versioned in Git
- Internal tooling repositories with team collaboration
- CI/CD pipelines backed by Git-based version control
- Contribution to open-source projects or internal monorepos
